# Using News to Predict Stock Movements 
This project contains my two submissions for Kaggle competition : [Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news).

* Refer to "Featured Notebooks/Analysis/Deliverables" section for fully executed Jupyter Notebooks

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is predict a signed confidence value that's correlated with stock price movement.  
Therefore, predicted signed confidence value can be used by the competition host to make better decisions on stock trading.

### Partner

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling


### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
